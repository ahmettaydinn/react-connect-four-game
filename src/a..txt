  Objective

  Be the first player to connect 4 of the same colored discs in a row (either 
  vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).

  How to play

  Red goes first in the first game.
  Players must alternate turns, and only one disc can be dropped in each turn. 
  The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row or a stalemate.
  The starter of the previous game goes second on the next game.
